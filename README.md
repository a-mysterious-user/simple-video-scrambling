## What is this repository about

- Developing approaches to *scramble* the video frames for transmission over public servers, with the intent to conceal the underlying information
- Related terminologies: video forensics, video steganography
- This repository mainly provides the following components:
    - Simulating the distortion caused by video compression
    - Providing the implementation for basic video scrambling techniques
    - Providing the interface for benchmarking different video scrambling techniques

## Usage

- Install Anaconda environment using `environment-*.yml` (currently the source code is only tested on Windows)
- Refer to the Jupyter notebooks in `example/` (note: videos do not show up in GitHub preview)
